# Damn, it's pretty.

Symbols, objects, these are written in english. Ruby sits right in how concise and terse
its language is.

Code can get long with curly braces everywhere closing statements.

# But

With Ruby, it is more natural. Ruby understands syntax is a more natural way. Stripped of
parenthesis and symbols, and replaced with your variables.

Its language is build around how we would define methods and attributes, in plain english.

# It's Difficult

It is loose, as in syntax does not need to be perfect. That means there is always a better way
of writing code. It is a backend language that manages data and collections. Easy to read code
is essential for relational models.

# And fun

There is a Ruby way, write less code.
